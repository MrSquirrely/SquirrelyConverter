# Squirrely Converters 

#### Update Augest 16th 2020
    I have decided once again to recode this project. Though not without reason.
    I try to do things that I haven't before, this project included one of these things.
    With this project I was trying to create a plugin system. I wasn't sure how to do this at the time.
    I tried my best but fell short. Recently I came back to this to resart what I wanted. 
    With the time away I have learned quite a bit. So I am able to do a plugin system decently well.
    That is my plan. To have a plugin system and stand alone versions of every converter/utility.

##### Simple Converters for Everyone :

Free, simple, and beautiful to use converters for everyone! 
The goal with this project isn't to create converters or utilities, it's to create beautiful converters and utilities.
For far to long we've had to deal with ugly, no more!
