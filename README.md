##### Simple Converters for Everyone
Free and easy converters that anyone can use. Currently supports images and videos. Audio, office, and zip support is coming soon.

## Images
Coming Soon!

## News
woot. Alright so 2.1 is becoming massive code hull. I'm adding the ability to create your own converters to load into the program. This is something I have never done before and quite honestly is taxing me a bit. I don't want to get to the point to where I don't want to work on it again so I'm taking a week long break. It isn't only the extensibility, it's fixing code, optimizing code, and trying to fight things not working like they should.
