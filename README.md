##### Simple Converters for Everyone
A Simple and easy to use converter for Images and Videos.
The original function was to be a WebP and WebM Converter. That is why WebP and WebM are the default selected image formats to convert to.

## What is WebP and WebM?
> [**WebP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) is an image format employing both lossy and lossless compression.<br>
> [**WebM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM) is a media file format. It is primarily intended to offer a royalty-free alternative to use in the HTML5 video and the HTML5 audio tags.
