## ToDo
## News
I will be removing costura fody in the next update, it's still there in the repo, but with the newest update the whole goal is to make it as lite as possible. We are doing this by not needing all the dlls for every converter that you don't want. With costura fody it loads all the dlls into the program so it is no longer needed. I'm also going to work on a website for this so I can post updates when I have them.
