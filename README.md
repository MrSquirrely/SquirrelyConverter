##### Simple Converters for Everyone
Free and easy converters that anyone can use. Currently supports images and videos. Audio, office, and zip support is coming soon.

## Images
Coming Soon!

## News
Alrighty, I lied I couldn't stay away, as soon I said I wanted to take a break I got like 100 new ideas! So I'm not stopping and I have no interest in stopping any time soon. I've added a license to the converter utils as it accrued to me that if someone wants to create a converter using the converter utils that I provide he or she would have to license under GPLv3 or similar and that is not cool of me. So the Converter Utils is licensed under LGPLv3.
