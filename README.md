# Squirrely Converter

###### A simple converter for WebP and WebM

### The current version is 0.5 because half of what I want is pressent.

There are some things I know I am changing.
	- Changing the tabs from "WebP & WebM" with "Encode and Decode" sub tabs to "Enocde and Decode" with "WebP and WebM" sub tabs.
	- Alowing you to drop both images and vides into the program.
	- Alowing you to change the colors of the program.
